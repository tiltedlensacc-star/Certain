        </div>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Certain! This app helps you track and confirm important safety tasks like locking doors and turning off appliances, reducing anxiety and giving you peace of mind.</p>

        <h3>How to Use Certain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Add Items:</strong> Tap the "+" button to create a new safety item. Choose whether it's a Lock/Unlock or On/Off type, give it a name, and assign it to a room.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm Actions:</strong> When you lock a door or turn off an appliance, tap the confirmation button on the item card to record the action and optionally take a photo.</li>
            <li><strong>Review History:</strong> Tap "Show Reassurance" on any item to see when you last confirmed it and view the photo you took.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Items:</strong> Swipe or long-press on items to edit or delete them.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: How many items can I add?</p>
            <p>The free version of Certain allows you to track up to 5 items. Upgrade to Certain Plus for unlimited items and photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: Where is my data stored?</p>
            <p>All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have access to your items, confirmations, or photos. This means your information is private and secure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: What happens if I delete the app?</p>
            <p>If you uninstall Certain, all your data will be permanently deleted from your device. Make sure to keep the app installed if you want to preserve your confirmation history.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: How do I cancel my Certain Plus subscription?</p>
            <p>Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone</li>
                <li>Tap your name at the top</li>
                <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
                <li>Select "Certain Plus"</li>
                <li>Tap "Cancel Subscription"</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: Can I use Certain on multiple devices?</p>
            <p>Since data is stored locally on each device, items you create on one device won't automatically appear on another. Each device maintains its own separate list of items.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: Why do photos help with peace of mind?</p>
            <p>Taking a photo when you confirm an action provides visual proof that you completed the task. When anxiety strikes later, you can review the photo to reassure yourself that yes, you did lock that door or turn off that appliance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: What's the difference between Lock/Unlock and On/Off items?</p>
            <p>These are just different ways to categorize your items based on their type:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lock/Unlock:</strong> For items like doors, windows, gates</li>
                <li><strong>On/Off:</strong> For items like stoves, irons, lights, heaters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both work the same way - the labels just match the type of item you're tracking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Q: How do I restore my Certain Plus purchase?</p>
            <p>Your subscription is tied to your Apple ID and will automatically restore when you reinstall the app on the same device or a new device using the same Apple ID.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>Photos aren't saving</h3>
        <p>Make sure Certain has permission to access your camera:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera</li>
            <li>Find "Certain" in the list</li>
            <li>Enable camera access</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Items disappeared</h3>
        <p>If your items have disappeared, the app data may have been cleared. Since all data is stored locally, we cannot recover it. This is why it's important to keep the app installed.</p>

        <h3>Subscription not activating</h3>
        <p>If you've purchased Certain Plus but it's not showing as active:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Close the app completely</li>
            <li>Reopen the app</li>
            <li>If the issue persists, try restarting your device</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Make confirming items part of your routine when leaving home</li>
            <li><strong>Take clear photos:</strong> Make sure your photos clearly show the item in its confirmed state</li>
            <li><strong>Use descriptive names:</strong> Name items clearly so you know exactly what they are (e.g., "Front Door Lock" instead of just "Door")</li>
            <li><strong>Organize by room:</strong> Grouping items by room makes them easier to find and confirm</li>
        </ul>
